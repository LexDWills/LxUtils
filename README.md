## What's This?

This is a free code repository for general purpose functions.

Want to smooth out a float value?
Want to change a Color's hue/saturation/value?
Want to rotate a Vector or convert to polar coordinates?
Want to camelCase a string, get the plural of any word, or check if a generic variable is null?
Want to not have to look up how to make Unity's Resources.Load work *every single time?* (That one's maybe just be me :P)

This repository is intended to answer these questions, give simple, well explained and thoroughly tested code to solve simple everyday problems, compressing their complex/cumbersome/technically difficult solutions into one-line function calls or extension methods.

All code is written in CSharp (C#), but is exhaustively documented so that the logic and formulas used can be transposed into most any language.
